 Depending on the configuration of ffmpeg, the final binary needs to seperately link to
 the ffmpeg libraries and additional libraries required by ffmpeg. 
 
 The following is the list of required ffmpeg libraries:
 
 libavformat 
 libswresample 
 libswscale 
 libavcodec
 libavfilter 
 libavutil
 
 Note that the order of the above libraries matter, because functions provided by
 libavutil are referenced by the preceding libraries.
 
 The following list of additional libraries may also be required depending on how ffmpeg
 was configured:
 
 libmp3lame 
 libopencore-amrnb 
 libopus
 libspeex 
 libvorbis 
 libvorbisenc
 libvpx 
 libx264

 libz
 libbz2
 libm
